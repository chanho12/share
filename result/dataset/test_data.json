Getting me and Denver through this here life is all that matters. You understand? PAUL : Dangerous to love anything that much, Sethe. Best thing is to love everything just a little bit..that way, when it breaks or runs off or gets taken, well maybe you'd have a little love left over for the next one. SETHE : Don't be asking me to choose, Paul D. There ain't no choice here. PAUL : That's the whole point. I'm not asking you to choose. Just want to know if there's some space for me.

ALYSSA : Don't even tell me you want to do it again. HOLDEN : Why me - you know? Why now? ALYSSA : Because you were giving me that look, and I got wet... HOLDEN : You know what I'm talking about. ALYSSA : Why not You? HOLDEN : I'm a guy. You're attracted to girls. ALYSSA : I see you've been taking notes. Historically, yes that's true. HOLDEN : Then why this? ALYSSA : I've given that a lot of thought, you know? I mean, now that I'm being ostracized by my friends, I've had a lot of time to think about all of this. And what I've come up with is really simple: I came to this on my terms. I didn't just heed what I was taught, you know? Men and women should be together, it's the natural way - that kind of thing. I'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one. The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare. My parents didn't really have it. There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships. And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. So I didn't. And by leaving my options open, I was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal - labels are labels, you know? They define what you do, not who you are, I guess. But then you come along. You - the one least likely; I mean, you were a guy. HOLDEN : Still am. ALYSSA : And while I was falling for you, I put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy. that one person who'd compliment me so completely. And so here we are, I was thorough when I looked for you, and I feel justified lying in your arms - because I got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace I didn't look. And that makes all the difference. HOLDEN : Shit. ALYSSA : What? HOLDEN : Well, you took the luster our of it. Of how I brought you back from the other side. How all you needed was the right man to turn you around. ALYSSA : You're not the right man. You're just the one.

She finds men attractive but is not sexually interested in them. She fell in love with Caitlin Bree in high school, and was physically active with her. She believes virginity is lost when you make love for the first time and not necessarily through penetration by the opposite sex. She also had sex with objects.\n    HOLDEN's persona : HOLDEN seems unsure about his work being on MTV and prefers doing personal work akin to their first book. He identifies himself and Banky as artists. He acknowledges some men to be attractive despite not being sexually attracted to them. He exhibited confusion and curiosity about Alyssa\u2019s sexual orientation and practices. He feels comfortable with women and adheres to standard societal definitions of virginity.\n    Shared Memory : Alyssa brings up a past incident, presumably an intimate moment, which made Holden uncomfortable.\n    ALYSSA's temporal information : HOLDEN wants to get back to personal work as soon as they have a personal statement to make.\n    HOLDEN's temporal information : \n    Mutual Memory : Alyssa and Holden have a deep discussion about their personal beliefs revolving around sexual orientation, societal standards, and the definition of virginity. The conversation leads to Alyssa revealing intimate details about her sex life.\n    Dialogue : ALYSSA : M-TV? HOLDEN : Twelve episodes. ALYSSA : That's great, isn't it? HOLDEN : Banky seems to think so. ALYSSA : But you don't. HOLDEN : I don't know if that's the perception I want people to have of our stuff. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but I like to think of us as artists. And I'd like to get back to doing something more personal - like our first book. ALYSSA : Well when are you going to do that? HOLDEN : As soon as we have something personal to say. ALYSSA : Do you know how pretty you are? HOLDEN : What? ALYSSA : You're a pretty man. HOLDEN : Uh... thanks. ALYSSA : Oh. I get it. I'm into girls, so I have to find all men repulsive or something. HOLDEN : I didn't say anything. ALYSSA : Aren't there some men that you find attractive? Granted, not enough to sleep with, but still - just handsome or something! HOLDEN : Sure. Harrison Ford. And our mail- man. ALYSSA : Well it's the same thing. I look at you and just find you really handsome. And you know, it has very little to do with your look, per-se. Your look is fine, don't get me wrong. But it's more your outlook. The things you say, the way you see things. It's... I don't know... attractive, I weirded you our the other night HOLDEN : Huh! No, not really. ALYSSA : Come on. HOLDEN : It's just that we've.., I mean, I've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal. It just took awhile to process, longer than usual. ALYSSA : Do you want to talk about it! HOLDEN : Um. If you want to. ALYSSA : I like you. I haven't liked a man in a long time. And I'm not a man-hater or something. It's just been some time since I've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live-into a stereotype of some sort. And I want you to feel comfortable with me, because I want us to be friends. So if there are things you'd like to know, it's okay to ask me. HOLDEN : Why girls? ALYSSA : Why men? HOLDEN : Because that's the standard ALYSSA : If that's the only reason you're attracted to women - because it's the standard.. HOLDEN : It's more than that. ALYSSA : So you've never been curious about men? HOLDEN : Curious about men? Well... I always wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw'. ALYSSA : You know what I mean. HOLDEN : No. ALYSSA : Why not! HOLDEN : No interest. ALYSSA : Because...? HOLDEN : Girls feel right. ALYSSA : And that's how I feel. I've never really been attracted to men. I'm more comfortable with the idea of girls. HOLDEN : Wait, wait, wait - you're still a virgin? ALYSSA : No. HOLDEN : But you've only been with girls. ALYSSA : You're saying a person's a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex? HOLDEN : Isn't that the standard definition? ALYSSA : Again with the standards. I think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time. HOLDEN : With a member of the opposite sex. ALYSSA : Why? Why only then? HOLDEN : Because that's the standard. ALYSSA : So if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin? HOLDEN : Of course not. ALYSSA : But rape is not the standard. So she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex. Hence, according to your definition, she'd still be a virgin. HOLDEN : Okay, I'll revise. Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken. ALYSSA : Then I lost my virginity at ten, because I fell on a fence post when I was ten, and it broke my hymen. Now I have to tell people that I lost it to a wooden post I'd known my whole young life? HOLDEN : Second revision - virginity is lost through penetration. ALYSSA : Physical penetration or emotional? HOLDEN : Emotional? ALYSSA : Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree when we were in high school. HOLDEN : Physical penetration. ALYSSA : We had sex. HOLDEN : Yeah, but not real sex. ALYSSA : I move to have that remark stricken from the record. On account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile. HOLDEN : Well where's the penetration in lesbian sex. A finger? Come on. I've had my finger in my ass but I wouldn't say I've had anal sex. ALYSSA : Did I hold up a finger? HOLDEN : You're kidding?!?! How...?!? ALYSSA : Our bodies are built to pass a child, for Christ's sake. HOLDEN : But doesn't it hurt?! ALYSSA : Sure. But in a good way. And it's only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved for really special occasions. HOLDEN : What about not-so-special occasions? ALYSSA : Tongue only. HOLDEN : But how can that be enough? I mean, let's be real - how big can a tongue even get? ALYSSA : Let's go. Come on. HOLDEN : Just...uh... just give me a moment."}
