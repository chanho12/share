That's why we can short- circuit the process...\nARIADNE: (ARIADNE is a thoughtful, inquisitive, and imaginative person) How?\nCOBB: (COBB guides ARIADNE through the concept of shared dreaming, demonstrating his expertise in this field) By taking over the creating part.

I wonder how those guys do it?\nSETH: (Everyday Language) Why go to all that trouble?\nLUTHER: (LUTHER is an older individual experienced in criminal activities, possibly a former burglar) Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes?

It's not perfect, but it's a career.\nWILL: (WILL has a more carefree lifestyle than CHET, with fewer rules and attachments) I guess that's just the difference between you and me. I'm like Riggs.

Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.\nPOTTER: (Everyday Language) You like it? I'll send you a box.\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) Well, I... I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?\nPOTTER: (POTTER is an old man who is widely disliked) George, now that's just what I like so much about you. George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it... or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.\nPOTTER: (Everyday Language) The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight... married, making, say... forty a week. Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man � who hates his job � who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?\nPOTTER: (POTTER wants to hire GEORGE) My point? My point is, I want to hire you.\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) Hire me?\nPOTTER: (POTTER offers GEORGE a job with a salary of twenty thousand dollars a year) I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.\nGEORGE: (GEORGE is surprised by the salary offer) Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars a year?\nPOTTER: (Everyday Language) You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?\nGEORGE: (GEORGE asserts his identity) Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.\nPOTTER: (Everyday Language) Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in � providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) Well, what about the Building and Loan?\nPOTTER: (POTTER offers GEORGE a three-year contract) Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?\nGEORGE: (GEORGE asks for twenty-four hours to consider the offer) Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I... I just... I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over?\nPOTTER: (Everyday Language) Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) I'd like to do that.\nPOTTER: (POTTER plans to draw up the contracts for GEORGE) In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.\nGEORGE: (Everyday Language) All right, sir.\nPOTTER: (Everyday Language) Okay, George?\n\n", "answer": "Okay, Mr. Potter. No... no... no... no, now wait a minute, here! I don't have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no! NO! Doggone it!

I own the Triple- Bar ranch. I want to apologize for some of the folks in town.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) They act like they're sitting on a keg.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) A keg...? Of what?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) I don't know. Maybe diamonds. Maybe gunpowder.\nSMITH: (SMITH is not entirely welcoming to strangers) No. Nothing like that. We're a little suspicious of strangers is all. Hangover from the old days.

I'd be proud to have you as my guest.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Thanks, but I'm afraid not.\nSMITH: (MACREEDY is missing an arm) You mean, because of your arm? I knew a man once, lost an arm in a threshing accident. Used to hunt all the time. But he was quite a man. He... I'm sorry. I... What I mean is -- if there's anything I can do while you're around...\nMACREEDY: (MACREEDY is searching for someone named Komako) I'm looking for... Never mind. Thanks, anyway.\nSMITH: (SMITH remembers a man named Komako) You're looking for what, Mr. Macreedy? Komako -- Sure, I remember him -- Japanese farmer. Never had a chance.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) No?\nSMITH: (SMITH is aware of Komako's relocation during the war) He got here in '41 -- just before Pearl Harbor. Three months later he was shipped to one of those relocation centers. Tough.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Which one did he go to?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Who knows?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) You think maybe if I wrote him, the letter would be forwarded?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) I'm sure it would.

I wouldn't want to see that girl get into trouble...\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) You wouldn't?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) ...what with rental permits, gas rationing... you know what I mean.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Sure. I admire your sturdy sense of responsibility.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) It's just, a girl like that has a future.\nMACREEDY: (MACREEDY is a retired man who was associated with the army) Let's talk about my future.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Do you have the time?\nMACREEDY: (MACREEDY has not found what he has been looking for in Adobe Flat yet) I don't seem to be going any place.\nSMITH: (MACREEDY is familiar with jeeps, which he learned in Italy, possibly during the war) I hear you handle a jeep real well.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) I have a way with jeeps. A certain familiarity.\nSMITH: (MACREEDY is a retired man who was associated with the army) I think I understand. You're an Army man. Where'd you get it?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Italy.\nSMITH: (SMITH recounted trying to enroll in the military the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed) Tough. I tried to get in myself, the day after those rats bombed Pearl Harbor.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) What stopped you?\nSMITH: (SMITH tried to enlist after Pearl Harbor but was rejected due to a medical condition) The physical. They wouldn't take me. The morning after Pearl, I was the first man in line at Marine recruiting in Sand City. And they wouldn't take me.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Tough.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) What do you do in Los Angeles, Mr. Macreedy?\nMACREEDY: (MACREEDY is in forced retirement) I'm retired.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) You're a pretty young man...\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) You might say I was forced into retirement.\nSMITH: (MACREEDY is in search of a man named Komako in Adobe Flat) What were you looking for in Adobe Flat?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Komako, like I told you. Like you told me, he wasn't there. What's so funny?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Nothing. It's just -- I don't believe you. I believe a man is as big as what he seeks. I believe you're a big man, Mr. Macreedy.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Flattery will get you nowhere.\nSMITH: (SMITH is prejudiced against Japanese-Americans) Why would a man like you be looking for a lousy Jap farmer?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Maybe I'm not so big.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Yes, you are. I believe that a man is as big as the things that make him mad. Nobody around here has been big enough to make you mad.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) What makes you mad, Mr. Smith?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Me...? Nothing in particular.\nMACREEDY: (SMITH is prejudiced against Japanese-Americans) I see. You're a big man, too. Only... ...the Japanese make you mad...\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) That's different. After the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor... after Bataan...\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) ...and Komako made you mad.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) It's the same thing. Loyal Japanese-Americans -- that's a laugh. They're mad dogs. Look at Corregidor, the death march.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) What did Komako have to do with Corregidor?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Wasn't he a Jap? Look, Macreedy, there's a law in this county against shooting dogs. But if I see a mad dog loose, I don't wait for him to bite me. I swear, you're beginning to make me mad.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) All strangers do.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Not all. Some of 'em. When they come here snooping.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Snooping for what?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) I mean, outsiders coming around, looking for something.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) For what?\nSMITH: (SMITH is proud of his Western heritage and protective of it) I don't know. People are always looking for something in this part of the West. To the historian, it's the \"Old West.\" To the book writers, it's the \"Wild West.\" To the businessmen, it's the \"Undeveloped West.\" They all say we're backward and poor, and I guess we are. We don't even have enough water. But this place, to us, is our West. I just wish they'd leave us alone.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Leave you alone to do what?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) I don't know what you mean. He went away, I told you. Shortly after he left, a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place. They burned it down. It was one of those things -- you know how kids are. What's funny?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Nothing. Only -- I don't believe you. Any more than I believed you about the letters.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) You don't seem to believe anything I say.\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Yes, I do -- about businessmen, for instance. I think a businessman would be interested in Adobe Flat.\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Why?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) All that land lying fallow. Could be put to some use. Like a graveyard. A historian might be interested, too. Because of the strange customs around here, such as burying cattle...\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Burying cattle...?\nMACREEDY: (Everyday Language) Something's buried out there. See these wild flowers? That means a grave. I've seen it overseas. I figure it isn't a man's grave or someone would have marked it. Sort of a mystery, isn't it?\nSMITH: (Everyday Language) Sort of.
