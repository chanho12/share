You and me, I don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what happens. There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison.

Not my father's conversion -- mine. You see, I had been hitting the acid pretty regularly at that time. I had achieved a few minor sensory deformities, some suicidal despairs, but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect. I mean, like wow, man! I mean, here was living afflatus right before my eyes! Within a week, my father had closed his Beacon Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the Mexican mountains. And I turned in my S.D.S. card and my crash helmet and followed him. It was a disaster, at least for me. My father had received the revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians. I masturbated a great deal. We lived in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit and crushed pi\ufffdon nuts. It was hideous. Within two months, I was back in Boston, a hollow shell and dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with everything. I turned to austerity, nursing school. I became haggard, driven and had shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father. I took up with some of the senior staff at the hospital. One of them, a portly psychiatrist, explained I was generated by an unresolved lust for my father. I apparently cracked up. One day, they found me walking to work naked and screaming obscenities. There was talk of institutionalizing me, so I packed a bag and went back to my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains. I've been there ever since. That's three years. My father is, of course, mad as a hatter. I watch over him and have been curiously content. You see, Doctor, I believe in everything.\nBOCK: Now what was that all about, Miss Drummond?\nBARBARA: I thought I was obvious as hell.

I'm in all the textbooks. I happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And you want to know something, Miss Drummond? I don't give a goddam. When I say I'm impotent, I mean I've lost even my desire for work, which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex. I've lost my raison d'etre, my purpose, the only thing I ever truly loved. It's all rubbish anyway. Transplants, antibodies, we manufacture genes, we can produce birth ectogenetically, we can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio!

Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.\nSALIERI: So you are. How is your pretty wife?\nMOZART: She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.\nSALIERI: I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.\nMOZART: So you see, this post is very important to me right now.\nSALIERI: Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.\nMOZART: Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?\nSALIERI: I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.\nMOZART: Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!\nSALIERI: My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.\nMOZART: Whom did they choose?\nSALIERI: Herr Sommer.\nMOZART: Sommer? Herr Sommer?

Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.\nMOZART: Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.\nSALIERI: You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?\nMOZART: No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.\nSALIERI: It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.\nMOZART: How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!\nSALIERI: How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.\nMOZART: They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat.

They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.

Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens. Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs.\nWARDEN: Listen.\nKAREN: He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine.\nWARDEN: Listen. Listen. Please.\nKAREN: And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana.

Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all. I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him. What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me. And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary. I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone. I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent. ...But Tom, you must know that I do this only because I believe you are the only one who is capable of taking over for me.

Have you ever had sex before?\nADAM: No.\nEVE: How is that possible?\nADAM: In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter. That's where I was born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That's also why I have no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should \"bring her on down\".

Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985.

And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- resistance.\nKAFFEE: Wow. I'm sexually aroused, Commander.\nJO: I don't think your clients murdered anybody.\nKAFFEE: What are you basing this on?\nJO: There was no intent.\nKAFFEE: The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. Now, I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad.\nJO: Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison.\nKAFFEE: Oh, now I see what you're saying.\nJO: I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.\nKAFFEE: Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania\nJO: Thank you.\nKAFFEE: I don't think you'll have much luck, though. I was assigned by Division, remember? Somebody over there thinks I'm a good lawyer.
